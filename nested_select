Using SELECT in SELECT
See SELECT FROM SELECT for how to use a derived table.

The result of a SELECT statement may be used as a value in another statement. For example the statement SELECT continent FROM world WHERE name = 'Brazil' evaluates to 'South America' so we can use this value to obtain a list of all countries in the same continent as 'Brazil'

1.
List each country in the same continent as 'Brazil'.

--
SELECT name FROM world WHERE continent = 
(SELECT continent 
FROM world WHERE name = 'Brazil')

Alias
Some versions of SQL insist that you give the subquery an alias. Simply put AS somename after the closing bracket:

SELECT name FROM world WHERE continent = 
  (SELECT continent FROM world WHERE name='Brazil') AS brazil_continent
Multiple Results
The subquery may return more than one result - if this happens the query above will fail as you are testing one value against more than one value. It is safer to use IN to cope with this possibility.

The phrase (SELECT continent FROM world WHERE name = 'Brazil' OR name='Mexico') will return two values ('North America' and 'South America'). You should use:

SELECT name, continent FROM world
WHERE continent IN
 (SELECT continent FROM world WHERE name='Brazil'
                                 OR name='Mexico')
